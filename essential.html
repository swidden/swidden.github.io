"I try to juxtapose the space of politics with the space of reverie, almost absurdity, the space of shelter with that of the desert; in all of this I try to perform the ‘blank spaces’ that are formed when everything is taken away from people."

SR: It has often amazed me how resilient children can be and in terms of cultural memory. What they absorb via osmosis is really interesting and this is really evident for me in your later work In Transit (2008), in which children toy with the memory of conflict through play.
<br><br>
LA: In Transit features a group of children who are playing at the site of an abandoned Soviet war plane. They are trying to repair it and fill the bullet holes with cotton wool, and even tie strings to it and attempt to resurrect it and fly it like a kite. Here I wanted to film children because in some sense they represent a kind of fantasy world - they are willing to forget a little in order to move forward, something their parents' generation is less capable of. The children approach the theme of violence by disarming it through and playfulness.

<br><br>    
SR: In later works your protagonists are largely children, such as in Dome (2005). Why did you choose to work with this particular protagonist?
<br><br>
LA: Children who live through conflict are surrounded by realities that they cannot fully comprehend and are therefore oblivious to atrocities. In Dome there  is a really beautiful encounter with chance. I was travelling with my camera crew to the outskirts of Kabul and came across this ruined mosque. There I saw a child dancing and whirling like a dervish and above him was an American war plane. He was totally unaware of his surroundings and was consumed in playing.   <br><br>
