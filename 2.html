        <h1><br><br>Seeing Value</h1>  
        
        <h2>Qin dynasty claim: “The power to determine value in material life was commensurate to the power of the cosmos itself.” 	
<br><br>
There are different interpretations of value including, of course, Marx’s labor theory of value as well as Moishe Postone’s reinterpretation of it. Value goes far beyond “money economics,” though the money-form as an object is of particular interest here. 
            
            <br>
         A brief interlude tells of a “hell bank note” whose design is based on the ten thousand dollar US federal reserve note, burned as a form of joss paper for the deceased to resolve assumed monetary issues in the afterlife. I will look into the origins of this particular “hell” note and what it may reveal about how Chinese identity is constructed overseas, over distance. Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern uses the phrase “making visible” and “giving value” more or less interchangeably in her work, which will be a jumping off point for my own thinking about value in relation to vision. I delve into a case study of a money-form which never was: in 2012, Canada’s one-hundred dollar bill was initially designed with the face of a generic female Asian-Canadian scientist. After outcry, her facial features were “neutralized” to look Caucasian. Here, a peculiar intersection of race and money becomes at least a useful way to think about the variability of money as a capitalist (rather than solely nationalist) fetish and its acceptable racialized personas in a supposedly multicultural place.
