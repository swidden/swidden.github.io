    </div><i><br> Research how the art school and the engineering school used to be connected. Make a graph. Interview an old-timer. Interview a “sciences” major who became an “arts” major. And versa-vice. Vice. Art as making. Art as conceptual. How does this connect to Daryll Hamamoto. The Dark Side. Capitalism and engineering and art. The age of enlightenment and schools privileging “sciences” as a separate disciplina from “artz.” In structure and in conversations of students. Paying respect. The Great Chain of Being and coloneyesation and splitting up “ideas” into concepts. Before you split ideas into “separate” concepts you can hold/sell, you need to be able to objectify them. English objectifies concepts in its words. Imperialist nostalgia. Splitting ideas into holdable sellable concepts as related to ‘majors.’ When do we ‘need’ to split ideas into labels/words, in order to “differentiate” between idears? Limits, borders, gradation-nations. Liek, to Differentiate among egg and ketchup, between tree and carrot, between taste and bait. ?!</font></i>

&emsp;The work takes its initial cues from candlestick charts, an 18th ce Japanese market visualization technique originally used to aid in the speculation of rice trading and later for stock market trading. Now used worldwide, it was not introduced to English-speaking traders until the 1990s. Individual candles or combinations of candles can provide insights for humans and AIs into the inner workings of the market and psychology of its participants.

    &emsp;Sampling from an EMT training library of lung sounds, EMF (electromagnetic frequencies) from the starting from a wifi router, and various '80s disco bangers attuned to the conditions of radical uncertainty (“no romance/without finance”, “so many men/so little time/how can I choose?”), in this work, candles dance and spin along in a formation market speculators might call “out of breath.” </font></i></div>
