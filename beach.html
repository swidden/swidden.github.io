      "For one of her projects she created a sound work reminiscent of guided meditation that alternated between authoritative and consumer based subjectivities in tone. The recording of her voice played inside a small room filled with sand from a local urban beach relocated by her collaborator. In the corner Maggie made a sculpture formed of fibrous and processed textiles and live green plant matter knotted together with paint hanging to the ground like a thwarted hammock. Interspersed in the room were rounded paintings forming tactile pastel topographic mounds. Together with ceramic vessels and found photographs, this installation constructed the desire to escape to an idealized haven. Whether this site is internal or externally located, it is fraught with problems. Maggie is comfortable with a paradoxical discursive place and explores this position within current western privilege. It is to this end she utilizes her materials and fabrication techniques to play with our desires and indict power inequities behind them." -Olga Koumoundouros
