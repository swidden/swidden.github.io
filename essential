"In my work, I try to juxtapose the space of politics with the space of reverie, the space of shelter with that of the desert; in all of this I try to perform the ‘blank spaces’ that are formed when everything is taken away from people."


SR: It has often amazed me how resilient children can be and in terms of cultural memory. What they absorb via osmosis is really interesting and this is really evident for me in your later work In Transit (2008), in which children toy with the memory of conflict through play.

LA: In Transit features a group of children who are playing at the site of an abandoned Soviet war plane. They are trying to repair it and fill the bullet holes with cotton wool, and even tie strings to it and attempt to resurrect it and fly it like a kite. Here I wanted to film children because in some sense they represent a kind of fantasy world - they are willing to forget a little in order to move forward, something their parents' generation is less capable of. The children approach the theme of violence by disarming it through and playfulness.

AM: The austere, battle-scarred landscape of Afghanistan is a central character in your video work. It has survived decades of war and is littered with ruins and monuments. How do you relate to this unique topography?

LA : I've made work in and around the real and imagined Afghanistan because I knew I had to come to terms with all this stuff within me. For some people loss becomes a dwelling. So I hope people see in the piece I've made references not just to Afghanistan but to the a certain condition, the other side of moving forward fast, the mute reminder without reference.

AM: You have described how, for you, art is 'a petition for another world'. This a beautiful idea, do you believe that art can truly change the world?

LA: Whatever transformation art has the potential to bring about cannot be immediately seen. It's an invisible process simultaneously cathartic and active. I feel that only if people engaged with one another through their art, culture and music and genuinely resist trying to reduce the 'other' to what is familiar to themselves, a lot of change can come about.
